# Let Us C 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to **Let Us C** programs and my 100 Days of C challenge.  
Each program is written in C language and organized by topic.

## 📂 Structure
- Basics → simple input/output, addition, area, etc.
- Operators → swap, calculator, temperature conversion ,etc
- Loops → factorial, reverse, patterns,etc
- Function → parameters,arguments,return,void,resurrsion etc
- pointer → reference,deference,double pointer,pointer in function,etc.
- array → read array, elements of array ,binary , address of array , randint array , matrices of array , etc
- Structures → defining structures, structure variables, array of structures, pointer to structures
- DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation)** → malloc, calloc, realloc, free
- PPOs (Preprocessor Directives)** → #define, macros, #include, conditional compilation.
- Enum → enum declaration, enum variables, use cases in programs
 

## 🛠 How to Run
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
